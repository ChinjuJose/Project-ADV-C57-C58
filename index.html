			<p>Watching movies is something that I would love to do to relax nowadays. After a hard-working day, what can be more satisfying than watching films and concentrating with amusement on the plots? <br /> <br />
				When I am watching a movie, I forget about the outside world for a moment and don’t think about any of my problems. It teaches us to appreciate and enjoy our life. I love to enjoy a good laugh watching a rom com. </p>

		<h4>My Ultimate Favourite</h4>
		<h3>Letters to Juliet</h3>
		<p>Letters to Juliet is a 2010 American romantic comedy-drama film starring Amanda Seyfried, Christopher Egan, Gael García Bernal, Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero. This was the final film of director Gary Winick. The film was released theatrically in North America and other countries on May 14, 2010. The idea for the film was inspired by the 2006 non-fiction book Letters to Juliet, by Lise Friedman and Ceil Friedman, which chronicles the phenomenon of letter-writing to Shakespeare's most famous romantic heroine.</p>
